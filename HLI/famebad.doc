Inconsistencies
---------------

1. a name ending in "a?" means that the "a?" is not used in calling
the function within perl, but that it really calls a wrapper C function
with the "a" appended (which calls the C HLI).  If using an older 
version of mus, then perl will show the "a" as required, but it 
really is not.

2. a name ending in "!" cannot be implemented

3. a FAULT of "7.5" means the function is new in 7.5 and is not
linked into the fameperl

4. a FAULT of "not in 6.0" means the function is not documented
in the 6.0 manual.  The parameter order is taken from the 
header file and may not be correct.

5. everthing else either has flattened arrays or behaves differently
for each data type.
