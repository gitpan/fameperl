Instructions for installing fameperl with Perl 5
------------------------------------------------

You must have perl installed and running before beginning.  Make
sure to make perl first, as fameperl uses most of the same files.
This version of fameperl is made to run with perl 5.003.

1.  Use "cd" to change to the perl source code directory.  If perl 
    source code is in /usr/gnu/src/perl5.003, then type

       cd /usr/gnu/src/perl5.003/ext

2.  Create the Fame directory and files from the tar file.  If your
    tar file /usr/home/joe/Fame-2.tar, then type

       tar xf /usr/home/joe/Fame-2.tar

3.  Change to the new Fame extensions directory

       cd Fame-2

4.  View the README file and follow the instructions there to
    build everything.
